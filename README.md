# CareerSwipe

Job search engine with swiping actions for rejecting or storing listings

## How it's built

We're using a React front end with functional components and hooks, and Context for state management, to eliminate the need for Redux.

On the backend we're going to use Firebase.

## What it does

The basic function of this app will be a Tinder for jobs. It seeks to solve the issue of seeing the same jobs multiple times. During the job seeking process, we tend to look at tens, if not hundreds of jobs, and they can start to run together over time. CareerSwipe tries to eliminate that pain point, by "saving" jobs we like for future use, and "rejecting" jobs we've seen and don't like or don't want to see again.

## ** NOTE: THIS APP IS NOT YET FINISHED AND IS BEING KEPT HERE FOR BACKUP PURPOSES. FEEL FREE TO BROWSE THE CODE, BUT DO NOT CLONE OR REFER TO FOR ANYTHING. **
